The numpy.shape() function recieves a numpy matrix as a parameter and return the size of each dimension of the matrix as a tuple. In our case, our image is in the BGR format, so we have a three dimensional matrix, with the return tuple containing the height, width, and amount of colors (Should be 3, because blue, green, and red), respectively.\n",

    "Looking at the results of printing the image matrix to console, we can look at each individual pixel in the image. Referencing above, the first value in the group of three numbers represents the intensity of blue, the second represents green, and the last, red. The values can have a minimun of 0 (Black) and a maximun of 255 (Max saturation of color); the reason for this is that one color value is stored as a byte (8 bits, with a bit being 0 or 1) and 2^8 = 256 different shades of that one color, otherwise known as an unsigned 8-bit integer. We also note the structure of the matrix, which numpy essentialy uses nested lists in order to create the matrix. The colors are grouped into lists of pixels, and the lists of pixels are grouped row by row."

    "Here we start by extracting the values from the tuple returned by the numpy.shape() function. Note the undescore placed after the width variable; this essentially means that we are not using the last value in the tuple so ignore the value. Now, since the matrix format for a grayscale image (2-D) is different than that of a color image (3-D), we must create a new matrix that will hold the values for the grayscale conversion. The numpy.zeros() function takes 2 parameters, a tuple of the size of the dimensions of the matrix (i.e a 2x3 matrix would be (2,3), while a 7x14x3 matrix is (7,14,3)) and the datatype of the values stored in the array. The last parameter is optional, but the default value is a floating point number, which is not the same datatype we're using (8 bit unsigned integers), so in our case, we have to add this parameter. The function returns a matrix filled with the number 0."
